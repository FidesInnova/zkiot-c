## Function-hiding functional commitment
This repository is a C++ library for the **function-hiding functional commitment zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)** scheme. This scheme is a tuple _(setup, commit, eval)_ that utilizes the following three protocols:
### 1- A polynomial commitment scheme
### 2- A proof of function relation (PFR)
### 3- An algebraic holographic proof (AHP)
